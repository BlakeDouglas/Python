This program simulates a UDP Pinger from a client to a server with 10 messages
and a 1 second timeout time for the server to respond. While sending the message,
it calculates the round trip time for all of the messages and outputs 
the max, min, and average for the messages that were returned.
To help simulate the UDP connection, the server ignores the client request 
randomly 30% of the time.
